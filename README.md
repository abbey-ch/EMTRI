EMTRI LLC ERC-20 Token Implementation


## Overview

 EMTRI Corporation, incorporated and registered in California, USA; 'EMTRI'.

 EMTRI empowers the Farmers, Cultivators, Strain Producers and Distributors (clients) who work to bring quality medical-grade & premium adult-use cannabis to the market.
 
 EMTRI clients use Ethereum blockchain technologies to attest to their crop cultivations. In return for attesting to crop lifecycle events using blockchain, 
 EMTRI rewards its clients with EMT tokens, the 'mint'.
 
 EMTRI introduces clients to cannabis distributors that sell the attested-to cannabis to wholesale and retail customers, who actually pay a cash premium to EMTRI because the cannabis their clients produce is attestested to using blockchain.

 Up to 50% of the cash premium paid to EMTRI is used to buyback EMT tokens on the Uniswap decentralized token exchange, the 'burn'. So, EMTs are minted only as cultivator and distributor rewards, and then bought back upon the sale of the client cannabis, thereby creating the Uniswap marketplace.
